          <h2>What is Memory?</h2>
          <p>
            The game of Memory, also known as Concentration, is a popular card game that challenges players' memory and cognitive skills. It typically consists of a deck of face-down playing cards, each with a matching pair. Players take turns flipping over two cards, aiming to find matching pairs by remembering the location of previously revealed cards. When a pair is successfully matched, those cards are removed from play. The game continues until all pairs are found, and the player with the most pairs wins. <br><br>
            Memory is believed to have its roots in a centuries-old game called Pairs or Pelmanism, which was played with a standard deck of cards. The modern version of Memory, as we know it today, was created by children's book author and illustrator H.A. Rey in the early 1950s. Rey, known for the Curious George series, designed the game using colorful illustrations on square cards. <br><br>
            Memory quickly gained popularity and became a classic educational game for children. It is valued for its ability to enhance memory, concentration, and cognitive skills while providing entertainment. Over the years, Memory has evolved with various themed editions featuring different images and themes, making it appealing to a wide range of audiences. Today, Memory remains a beloved pastime enjoyed by individuals of all ages, contributing to cognitive development and fostering social interaction.
